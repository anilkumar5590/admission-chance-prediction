## Admission Chance Prediction
This Streamlit web application predicts the chance of admission for prospective students based on their academic and research-related details. The prediction is made using a Linear Regression model trained on historical admission data.

## Setup and Usage
1. Environment Setup
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
```
2. Running the Streamlit App

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.
- Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
- Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

    - Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Strength
    - Undergraduate CGPA
    - Research Experience (Binary: 0 for No, 1 for Yes)
* Click the "Make Prediction" button to generate the admission chance prediction.
* The predicted admission chance will be displayed on the app interface.
